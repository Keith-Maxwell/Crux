This is a reproduction of the card game [CRUX](https://arealgamesco.com/products/problem-game)

>Created from a love of both climbing and card games, CRUX is a simple yet strategic game to play.
>The concept is simple, draw cards to complete your problem while preventing your opponents from doing the same.
